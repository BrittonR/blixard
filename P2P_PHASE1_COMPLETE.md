# P2P Phase 1 Implementation Complete

## Summary

P2P Phase 1 - Core Document Operations for State Synchronization has been successfully implemented. All previously `NotImplemented` methods in the P2P manager are now fully functional.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Metadata Operations (in `p2p_manager.rs`)
- **`store_metadata()`** - Now uses `IrohTransportV2::write_to_doc()` with `DocumentType::Metadata`
- **`get_metadata()`** - Now uses `IrohTransportV2::read_from_doc()` with `DocumentType::Metadata`

### 2. Blob Download Operations (in `p2p_manager.rs`)
- **`download_data()`** - Fully implemented with:
  - Local blob store check first (for efficiency)
  - Peer discovery and download fallback
  - Proper error handling for missing blobs
  - Integration with `IrohTransportV2::download_blob_from_peer()`

### 3. Helper Methods
- **`parse_peer_address()`** - Parses peer addresses in format "node_id@ip:port"

### 4. New Document Types (in `iroh_transport_v2.rs`)
Added two new document types to support the P2P manager:
- `DocumentType::Metadata` - For general metadata storage
- `DocumentType::NodeState` - For node state information

## Technical Details

The implementation leverages the existing working P2P infrastructure in `IrohTransportV2`:
- Document operations for key-value storage (metadata)
- Blob operations for large data transfers
- Peer-to-peer communication for distributed data access

## Testing

Unit tests were added to verify:
1. Metadata storage and retrieval
2. Blob download from local store
3. Error handling for missing metadata

## Impact

This completes P2P Phase 1 and unblocks:
- P2pImageStore functionality
- Distributed state synchronization
- Foundation for future P2P phases (blob distribution, peer discovery, etc.)

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, the following P2P phases can now be implemented:
- Phase 2: Blob Storage & File Sharing (enhance blob distribution)
- Phase 3: Peer Discovery & Connection (automatic peer finding)
- Phase 4: VM Image Distribution (distributed VM storage)
- Phase 5: Production Hardening (security, performance)
