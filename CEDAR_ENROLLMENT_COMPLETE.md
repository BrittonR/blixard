# Certificate-Based Enrollment Implementation Complete âœ…

## Overview

I've successfully implemented certificate-based enrollment for automatic node registration, as requested ("lets do 2"). This feature allows nodes to automatically receive appropriate roles and permissions based on either enrollment tokens or X.509 certificate attributes.

## Components Implemented

### 1. **Core Enrollment Module** (`transport/iroh_identity_enrollment.rs`)
- `EnrollmentToken` - Secure tokens with expiration and usage limits
- `CertificateEnrollmentConfig` - Certificate attribute to role mappings
- `IdentityEnrollmentManager` - Main enrollment orchestrator
- Pattern matching for certificate attributes (supports wildcards)
- Persistent state management for tokens

### 2. **Key Features**
- **Token-Based Enrollment**:
  - Single-use or multi-use tokens
  - Expiration and usage limits
  - Secure random token generation
  - Token revocation support

- **Certificate-Based Enrollment**:
  - Pattern matching on certificate fields (CN, OU, O, etc.)
  - Wildcard support (e.g., `*.ops.example.com`)
  - Automatic role assignment based on patterns
  - Tenant assignment per mapping

- **State Persistence**:
  - Tokens saved to disk (JSON format)
  - Automatic state recovery on restart
  - Concurrent access safety

### 3. **Integration Points**
- Works with existing `NodeIdentityRegistry`
- Integrates with Cedar authorization system
- Compatible with both gRPC and Iroh transports
- Thread-safe for concurrent enrollments

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`tests/iroh_identity_enrollment_test.rs`)
- Token generation and validation
- Single-use vs multi-use tokens
- Certificate pattern matching
- Expiration handling
- Concurrent enrollment
- State persistence

### Examples
1. **`examples/iroh_enrollment_demo.rs`** - Interactive demo showing:
   - Token generation
   - Certificate enrollment simulation
   - Authorization integration

2. **`examples/secure_iroh_demo.rs`** - Updated with enrollment context

3. **`docs/examples/enrollment-setup.md`** - Comprehensive guide including:
   - Configuration examples
   - Cloud provider integration (AWS, GCP)
   - Kubernetes deployment
   - Security best practices

## Usage Patterns

### Generate Enrollment Token
```rust
let token = manager.generate_enrollment_token(
    "operator-alice".to_string(),
    vec!["operator".to_string(), "admin".to_string()],
    "operations".to_string(),
    Duration::from_days(7),
    false,  // single-use
    None,
).await?;
```

### Enroll with Token
```rust
let result = manager.enroll_with_token(
    node_id,
    &token.token_id,
    &token.secret,
).await?;
```

### Certificate-Based Enrollment
```rust
let mut cert_attrs = HashMap::new();
cert_attrs.insert("CN".to_string(), "alice.ops.example.com".to_string());
cert_attrs.insert("OU".to_string(), "Operations".to_string());

let result = manager.enroll_with_certificate(
    node_id,
    cert_attrs,
).await?;
```

## Pattern Matching Examples

The system supports flexible pattern matching for certificate attributes:

- `*.ops.example.com` - Matches any ops subdomain
- `monitoring-*` - Matches any monitoring service
- `node-*-prod` - Matches production nodes
- `*` - Matches anything

## Integration with Cedar

Enrolled nodes automatically work with Cedar policies:

```cedar
// Ops team members (enrolled via *.ops.example.com pattern)
permit(
  principal in Role::"operator",
  action in [Action::"createVM", Action::"deleteVM"],
  resource is VM
)
when {
  principal.tenant == resource.tenant
};
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**:
   - 32-character random secrets
   - Secure storage with file permissions
   - Expiration enforcement
   - Usage tracking

2. **Certificate Validation**:
   - CA certificate verification
   - Pattern-based authorization
   - No hardcoded credentials

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - All enrollments logged
   - Token usage tracked
   - Failed attempts recorded

## Next Steps

With certificate-based enrollment complete, the next logical steps would be:

1. **Production Hardening**:
   - Integrate with HSM for token generation
   - Add metrics for enrollment monitoring
   - Implement token rotation policies

2. **Cloud Integration**:
   - AWS IAM role mapping
   - GCP Workload Identity support
   - Azure Managed Identity integration

3. **Enterprise Features**:
   - LDAP/AD group mapping
   - SAML assertion support
   - OAuth2 device flow

The certificate-based enrollment system is now fully implemented and ready for use!
