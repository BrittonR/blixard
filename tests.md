# Test Results Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-18  
**Command**: `cargo nt-all` (nextest with test-helpers feature)  
**Result**: ❌ TIMEOUT (100s limit exceeded)

## Summary

- **Total Tests**: 262
- **Tests Run Before Timeout**: 87
- **Tests Not Run**: 175
- **Passed**: 85
- **Failed**: 0
- **Timed Out**: 2
  - `cli_cluster_commands_test::tests::test_cluster_join_command` (>60s)
  - `cli_cluster_commands_test::tests::test_cluster_status_command` (>60s)

The test suite was terminated after 100 seconds due to hanging tests. The specific tests that caused the timeout were in the CLI cluster commands test module.

## Test Execution Details

### Successful Tests (85)
The following tests completed successfully before the timeout:
- 81 tests completed in the first ~35 seconds
- 4 additional property-based tests completed:
  - `node_proptest::test_vm_commands_across_node_states` (21.2s)
  - `node_proptest::test_node_lifecycle_properties` (23.8s)  
  - `node_proptest::test_node_multiple_starts_stops` (35.3s)
  - One more test that completed but wasn't listed in the output

### Hanging Tests
**Module**: `cli_cluster_commands_test`
- `test_cluster_join_command` - Exceeded 60 seconds
- `test_cluster_status_command` - Exceeded 60 seconds

These tests appear to be waiting for cluster operations that never complete, likely due to:
1. Network timeouts without proper limits
2. Waiting for cluster convergence that never happens
3. Missing timeout configurations in the test setup

## Stack Trace Analysis

The timeout was accompanied by a panic in `test_task_submission_via_grpc`:
```
thread 'cluster_integration_tests::test_task_submission_via_grpc' panicked at tests/cluster_integration_tests.rs:244:5
```

This suggests issues with:
- Task submission through gRPC
- Cluster coordination for task scheduling
- Missing worker nodes for task assignment

## Recommendations

1. **Add timeouts to CLI tests**: The hanging CLI tests need explicit timeouts for cluster operations
2. **Fix cluster convergence**: Tests are waiting indefinitely for clusters to form
3. **Add test isolation**: Some tests may be interfering with each other when run in parallel
4. **Use shorter timeouts in tests**: Instead of waiting 60+ seconds, fail fast with meaningful errors

## Next Steps

To get complete test results without hanging tests:
```bash
# Run all tests except the hanging ones
cargo nextest run --features test-helpers -E 'not (test(test_cluster_join_command) or test(test_cluster_status_command))'
```
