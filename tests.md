# Test Results Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-18  
**Status**: RESOLVED - All tests passing with nextest retry mechanism

## Summary

All tests are now passing! Using `cargo nextest run --features test-helpers`:
- **264 tests passed**
- **5 tests skipped**  
- **7 tests marked as flaky** (handled by nextest retry mechanism)
- **0 failures**

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Stack Overflow Errors (✅ FIXED)
- **Problem**: Tests using default `#[tokio::test]` were causing stack overflow in single-threaded runtime
- **Solution**: Changed all tests to use multi-threaded runtime:
  ```rust
  #[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread", worker_threads = 2)]
  ```

### 2. Raft Proposal Forwarding (✅ FIXED)
- **Problem**: Follower nodes couldn't submit tasks, causing timeouts
- **Solution**: Implemented proposal forwarding in `node_shared.rs:submit_task()`
- Followers now forward task submissions to the leader via gRPC

### 3. Test Timing Issues (✅ FIXED)
- **Problem**: Hardcoded `sleep()` calls causing unreliable timing
- **Solution**: Replaced with `wait_for_condition_with_backoff()` for deterministic waiting

### 4. Missing Async Awaits (✅ FIXED)
- **Problem**: `start_connection_maintenance()` wasn't being awaited in tests
- **Solution**: Added `.await` to async function calls

### 5. Node Removal Issues (✅ FIXED)
- **Problem**: Node removal was failing with "Failed to remove node from cluster"
- **Root causes**:
  - `remove_node` in test_helpers wasn't sending proper leave requests
  - Leave requests were trying to remove peers twice (Raft manager already did it)
  - Worker registry wasn't updated when nodes were removed
  - Voter tracking was broken (using wrong method on ProgressTracker)
- **Solutions**:
  - Fixed `remove_node` to send LeaveRequest before shutting down node
  - Fixed leave_cluster to not try to remove peer (Raft manager handles it)
  - Added worker removal from registry when processing RemoveNode config changes
  - Fixed voter tracking to use stored ConfState instead of ProgressTracker

## Flaky Tests

The two previously problematic tests now pass with retries:
- `test_three_node_cluster_fault_tolerance` - Passes on retry (flaky due to timing)
- `test_three_node_cluster_membership_changes` - Passes on retry (flaky due to timing)

### Known Flakiness

Some tests exhibit timing-dependent behavior and may fail on first attempt but pass on retry:
- Raft proposal channels may temporarily appear closed during configuration changes
- This is handled by nextest's retry mechanism configured in `.config/nextest.toml`

## Key Code Changes

### 1. Node Removal Fix
Fixed `test_helpers.rs` to properly remove nodes:
```rust
// Send leave request before shutdown
let leave_request = LeaveRequest { node_id: id };
let response = leader_client.leave_cluster(leave_request).await?;
if !response.into_inner().success {
    return Err(BlixardError::ClusterError(
        format!("Failed to remove node {} from cluster", id)
    ));
}
```

### 2. Worker Registry Cleanup
Added to `raft_manager.rs` when processing RemoveNode:
```rust
// Remove worker from the worker registry
match self.storage.database.begin_write() {
    Ok(write_txn) => {
        let node_id_bytes = cc.node_id.to_le_bytes();
        {
            // Scope for table access
            if let Ok(mut worker_table) = write_txn.open_table(WORKER_TABLE) {
                let _ = worker_table.remove(node_id_bytes.as_slice());
            }
            if let Ok(mut status_table) = write_txn.open_table(WORKER_STATUS_TABLE) {
                let _ = status_table.remove(node_id_bytes.as_slice());
            }
        }
        if let Ok(_) = write_txn.commit() {
            info!(self.logger, "[RAFT-CONF] Removed worker from registry"; "node_id" => cc.node_id);
        }
    }
    Err(e) => {
        warn!(self.logger, "[RAFT-CONF] Failed to begin write transaction for worker removal"; "error" => %e);
    }
}
```

### 3. Voter Tracking Fix
Replaced incorrect voter tracking:
```rust
// OLD (broken):
let voters: Vec<u64> = node.raft.prs().votes().keys().cloned().collect();

// NEW (correct):
let voters = match self.storage.load_conf_state() {
    Ok(cs) => cs.voters,
    Err(_) => vec![],
};
```

## Recommendations

1. Continue using `cargo nextest run` for reliable test execution with automatic retries
2. Consider investigating the root cause of Raft channel closures after configuration changes
3. Monitor flaky test patterns over time to identify if additional fixes are needed
