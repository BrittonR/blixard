# Blixard Fresh Start

## What Was Kept

We've nuked the entire repository except for these essential files:

1. **Configuration Files**
   - `Cargo.toml` - Project dependencies and configuration
   - `Cargo.lock` - Locked dependency versions
   - `rust-toolchain.toml` - Rust version specification
   - `flake.nix` - Nix development environment
   - `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns
   - `build.rs` - Build script for proto compilation

2. **Documentation**
   - `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant guidelines
   - `README.md` - Project overview

3. **Core Types**
   - `src/types.rs` - Clean domain types (NodeConfig, VmConfig, etc.)
   - `src/error.rs` - Error type definitions

4. **Protocol Definition**
   - `proto/blixard.proto` - gRPC service definitions

5. **Minimal Scaffolding** (newly created)
   - `src/lib.rs` - Minimal library root
   - `src/main.rs` - Basic CLI structure

## Why This Clean Slate?

The previous codebase had become tangled with:
- Confusion between simulation and real runtime
- Mixed approaches to deterministic testing
- Complex feature flags and conditional compilation
- Duplicate test strategies that weren't actually working as intended

## What's Next?

With this clean foundation, you can:

1. **Choose a Clear Testing Strategy**
   - Either commit to MadSim with all its complexity
   - Or use traditional testing approaches
   - But be clear about which you're doing

2. **Build Incrementally**
   - Start with core node functionality
   - Add Raft consensus
   - Layer on VM management
   - Each piece tested appropriately

3. **Learn from What Worked**
   - The type definitions were clean
   - The gRPC protocol was well-designed
   - The error handling structure was good

4. **Avoid Previous Pitfalls**
   - Don't mix simulation and real runtime without clear boundaries
   - Don't claim deterministic testing unless actually implementing it
   - Keep test strategies simple and verifiable

## Current State

The project now:
- Compiles successfully ✓
- Has minimal CLI that reports "not implemented" ✓
- Retains all important type definitions ✓
- Keeps the development environment setup ✓
- Is ready for a fresh implementation approach ✓

The backup of all files is in `../blixard-backup/` if you need to reference old code.
