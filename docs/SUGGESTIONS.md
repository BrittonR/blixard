# Rust Crate Recommendations for Blixard NixOS MicroVM Platform

This document provides comprehensive recommendations for Rust crates and libraries to use in the Gleam to Rust migration of Blixard, transforming it into a **NixOS-native distributed microVM orchestration platform** with Ceph storage integration. Recommendations are based on production readiness, performance, virtualization capabilities, NixOS integration, and deterministic testing support.

**üéØ NixOS-First Philosophy**: Blixard is designed exclusively for NixOS environments, leveraging the Nix package manager, NixOS modules, microvm.nix, and the broader Nix ecosystem for truly declarative and reproducible infrastructure.

## üîß microvm.nix Integration Strategy

Blixard orchestrates VMs through microvm.nix rather than managing hypervisors directly:

```toml
# For interfacing with microvm.nix
nix = "0.27"                 # Rust Nix bindings for flake evaluation
serde_json = "1.0"           # Parse microvm.nix JSON configs
tempfile = "3.8"             # Temporary flake generation

# For monitoring VMs created by microvm.nix
procfs = "0.16"              # Monitor VM processes
systemd = "0.11"             # Track microvm systemd services
```

### Key Integration Points:
1. **VM Creation**: Generate microvm.nix flakes, then execute via Nix
2. **VM Monitoring**: Track systemd services created by microvm.nix
3. **Resource Tracking**: Parse microvm.nix configs to understand allocations
4. **Live Migration**: Coordinate microvm.nix on source/target nodes

## üéØ Recommended Core Stack for MicroVM Orchestration

```

### Testing Framework (Critical)

```

## üß™ Testing Strategy Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
```rust
// Deterministic environment abstraction
use madsim::{Runtime, time::Duration};

#[madsim::test]
async fn test_consensus_with_partitions() {
    let mut sim = Runtime::new();
    
    // Create deterministic cluster
    let cluster = sim.create_cluster(5).await;
    
    // Inject network partition
    sim.partition_nodes([0, 1], [2, 3, 4]).await;
    
    // Verify consensus safety
    assert!(cluster.verify_no_split_brain().await);
}
```

### Phase 2: Property-Based Testing
```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn service_management_invariants(
        operations in prop::collection::vec(any::<ServiceOp>(), 1..100)
    ) {
        let cluster = create_test_cluster();
        
        for op in operations {
            cluster.apply(op)?;
            
            // Invariants that must always hold
            prop_assert!(cluster.all_nodes_agree_on_state());
            prop_assert!(cluster.no_duplicate_services());
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Fault Injection
```rust
use fail::fail_point;

impl ServiceManager {
    async fn start_service(&self, name: &str) -> Result<()> {
        // Inject network failures
        fail_point!("network_partition", |_| {
            Err(Error::NetworkPartition)
        });
        
        // Inject storage failures
        fail_point!("storage_failure", |_| {
            Err(Error::StorageUnavailable)
        });
        
        // Normal operation
        self.raft.propose(StartService { name }).await
    }
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture-Specific Recommendations

### For MicroVM Orchestration (Non-Negotiable)
```toml
[dependencies]
# Consensus for VM state
raft = "0.7"           # tikv/raft-rs
rocksdb = "0.22"       # VM metadata storage

# MicroVM management
kvm-ioctls = "0.16"    # KVM interface
vm-memory = "0.14"     # Guest memory
virtio-devices = "0.5" # Device emulation

# Ceph storage
ceph-rust = "4.0"      # Official Ceph interface
rad = "0.3"            # High-level RADOS

# Network virtualization
nispor = "1.2"         # Virtual networking

[dev-dependencies]
madsim = "0.2"         # VM simulation testing
proptest = "1.4"       # VM property testing
stateright = "0.30"    # Consensus model checking
vmm-sys-util = "0.12" # VMM testing utilities
```

### For Development Velocity (Faster Iteration)
```toml

redb = "2.0"           # Pure Rust metadata storage

# Simpler hypervisor for development
# (Use QEMU instead of Firecracker during development)

# Web interface for development
axum = "0.7"           # Ergonomic web dashboard
bincode = "1.3"        # Simple VM state serialization
color-eyre = "0.6"     # Enhanced error reporting

# Development-focused VM management
serde_json = "1.0"     # Human-readable VM configs
toml = "0.8"           # Configuration files
```

### For Maximum Performance (Production)
```toml
[dependencies]
# High-performance metadata storage
rocksdb = "0.22"       # Cluster metadata

# Optimized hypervisor
# (Use Firecracker for production)

# High-performance serialization

# Performance monitoring
prometheus = "0.13"    # VM metrics collection
```

## üè† NixOS System Requirements

Blixard is designed exclusively for NixOS and requires the following configuration:

### NixOS Configuration
```nix
# /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }: {
  # Blixard service (when available in nixpkgs)
  services.blixard = {
    enable = true;
    package = pkgs.blixard;
  };
  
  # Required system packages
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # Virtualization stack
    qemu_kvm
    libvirt
    microvm  # microvm.nix support
    
    # Ceph storage
    ceph
    
    # Network tools
    bridge-utils
    vlan
    
    # Development tools
    rustc
    cargo
    pkg-config
  ];
  
  # Enable required services
  virtualisation = {
    libvirtd.enable = true;
    kvmgt.enable = true;
  };
  
  # Enable microvm host support
  microvm.host.enable = true;
  
  # Network configuration
  networking.bridges.blixard0.interfaces = [];
  networking.vlans.blixard-mgmt = {
    id = 100;
    interface = "eth0";
  };
  
  # Ceph storage prerequisites
  services.ceph = {
    enable = true;
    # Will be configured by Blixard
  };
}
```

### Why NixOS-Only?
- **Reproducible Builds**: Nix ensures identical environments across all nodes
- **Atomic Updates**: NixOS generations provide safe system updates
- **Declarative Configuration**: Everything defined in configuration.nix
- **microvm.nix Integration**: Deep integration with the microvm ecosystem
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Perfect match for VM orchestration
- **Zero Configuration Drift**: Impossible with Nix's functional approach
