# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for Blixard, ensuring reliability, safety, and performance across all components.

## Testing Approaches

### 1. Deterministic Simulation Testing

**Complete MicroVM Simulation**: Test entire VM orchestration in simulated environment
- Storage Simulation: Simulate Ceph cluster behavior, OSD failures, network partitions
- Hypervisor Simulation: Mock Firecracker/KVM operations for deterministic testing
- Network Partition Simulation: Verify VM and storage behavior during network splits
- Node Failure Simulation: Test VM live migration and Ceph rebalancing
- Time Acceleration: Run months of VM lifecycle operations in minutes

```rust
#[madsim::test]
async fn test_vm_cluster_partition_tolerance() {
    let mut sim = create_simulation(5).await;
    
    // Create VMs with Ceph storage across cluster
    sim.create_vm_stack("webapp", VMConfig {
        replicas: 3,
        storage: CephStorageSpec {
            pool: "ssd-pool",
            replication: 3,
            size_gb: 20,
        },
        hypervisor: HypervisorType::Firecracker,
    }).await;
    
    // Simulate network partition
    sim.partition_nodes([0, 1], [2, 3, 4]).await;
    
    // Verify VM consensus safety and Ceph quorum
    assert!(sim.verify_no_vm_split_brain().await);
    assert!(sim.verify_ceph_quorum_maintained().await);
    assert!(sim.verify_vm_availability("webapp").await);
    
    // Simulate live migration during partition
    sim.trigger_live_migration("webapp-1", "node4").await;
    assert!(sim.verify_vm_migrated_successfully().await);
    
    // Heal partition and verify convergence
    sim.heal_partition().await;
    assert!(sim.verify_cluster_convergence().await);
    assert!(sim.verify_ceph_rebalancing_complete().await);
}
```

### 2. Property-Based Testing

**VM State Invariants**: Verify VMs never enter invalid states during lifecycle operations
- Storage Consistency: Ensure Ceph data consistency across all operations
- Consensus Safety: Ensure no two nodes disagree on VM or storage state
- Resource Constraints: Verify VM CPU/memory limits and Ceph placement rules
- Live Migration Safety: Ensure VM state preservation during migrations
- Storage Replication: Verify Ceph replication factor maintenance

```rust
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn vm_operations_maintain_invariants(
        operations in vec(any::<VMOperation>(), 1..100)
    ) {
        let cluster = TestCluster::new(3);
        
        for op in operations {
            cluster.apply_vm_operation(op)?;
            
            // VM and storage invariants that must always hold
            prop_assert!(cluster.all_nodes_agree_on_vm_state());
            prop_assert!(cluster.ceph_data_consistent());
            prop_assert!(cluster.no_vm_resource_violations());
            prop_assert!(cluster.storage_replication_satisfied());
            prop_assert!(cluster.vm_dependencies_satisfied());
            prop_assert!(cluster.no_orphaned_storage());
        }
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn live_migration_preserves_vm_state(
        vm_configs in vec(arbitrary_vm_config(), 1..10),
        migration_sequence in vec(migration_operation(), 1..20)
    ) {
        let cluster = TestCluster::new(5);
        
        // Create VMs
        for config in vm_configs {
            cluster.create_vm(config)?;
        }
        
        // Perform migration operations
        for migration in migration_sequence {
            let pre_state = cluster.capture_vm_state(&migration.vm_name);
            cluster.live_migrate(migration)?;
            let post_state = cluster.capture_vm_state(&migration.vm_name);
            
            // VM state must be preserved during migration
            prop_assert_eq!(pre_state.memory_contents, post_state.memory_contents);
            prop_assert_eq!(pre_state.cpu_state, post_state.cpu_state);
            prop_assert_eq!(pre_state.network_connections, post_state.network_connections);
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Chaos Engineering

- **VM Host Failures**: Kill hypervisor hosts during VM operations
- **Storage Chaos**: Simulate Ceph OSD failures, disk corruption, network splits
- **Hypervisor Chaos**: Crash Firecracker/KVM processes during VM lifecycle
- **Live Migration Failures**: Interrupt migrations at various stages
- **Network Chaos**: Introduce packet loss, delays, and VLAN partitions
- **Resource Pressure**: Simulate CPU, memory, disk, and network exhaustion
- **Clock Skew**: Test VM scheduling and storage operations with time drift

### 4. Performance Testing

- **Throughput Testing**: Maximum operations per second
- **Latency Testing**: Response time under various loads
- **Scalability Testing**: Performance with increasing cluster size
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU consumption profiling

## Quality Metrics

### Target Performance Characteristics

- **Consensus Latency**: < 10ms for local cluster operations
- **Service Start Time**: < 5 seconds for typical services
- **Cluster Convergence**: < 30 seconds after network partition healing
- **Throughput**: > 1000 service operations per second
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for properly configured clusters

### Reliability Requirements

- **Zero Split-Brain**: Mathematically impossible under correct operation
- **No Data Loss**: All committed operations are durable
- **Automatic Recovery**: < 60 seconds to detect and recover from failures
- **Partition Tolerance**: Continues operating with minority partitions

## Test Execution

### Continuous Integration

All tests run automatically on every commit:
- Unit tests: < 1 minute
- Integration tests: < 5 minutes
- Simulation tests: < 10 minutes
- Chaos tests: Nightly runs

### Local Development

Developers can run tests locally:
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run deterministic tests
cargo test --features simulation

# Run specific test suite
cargo test --test raft_deterministic_simulation_test

# Run with verbose output
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### Production Validation

Before each release:
1. Full simulation test suite with 1000+ scenarios
2. Chaos engineering tests in staging environment
3. Performance regression testing
4. Security vulnerability scanning

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Code Coverage**: > 90% of critical paths
