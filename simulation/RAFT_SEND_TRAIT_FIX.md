# Raft Send Trait Fix Summary

## Problem
The Raft tick loop in `raft_comprehensive_tests.rs` couldn't be spawned with `madsim::task::spawn` due to Send trait issues. The error was:
```
error: future cannot be sent between threads safely
```

This occurred because `TestRaftNode` methods were holding mutex guards across await points, and `MutexGuard` is not Send.

## Solution
1. **Made TestRaftNode Clone**: Added `#[derive(Clone)]` to TestRaftNode struct
2. **Changed Arc wrapping**: Removed Arc<TestRaftNode> and made TestRaftNode directly cloneable
3. **Fixed mutex guard scoping**: In `start_election()`, ensured all mutex guards are dropped before any await points:
   ```rust
   // Before: guard held across await
   let mut term = self.current_term.lock().unwrap();
   *term += 1;
   let election_term = *term;
   drop(term);
   
   // After: guard dropped in block scope
   let election_term = {
       let mut term = self.current_term.lock().unwrap();
       *term += 1;
       *term
   };
   ```
4. **Wrapped non-Send types**: Changed `message_tx` to use `Arc<std::sync::Mutex<Sender>>`

## Results
- ✅ All tests now compile successfully
- ✅ The Raft tick loop can be spawned with `spawn()`
- ✅ `test_leader_election_basic` passes
- ❌ Other tests fail because mock Raft needs full implementation

## Files Modified
- `simulation/tests/raft_comprehensive_tests.rs`

## Key Learnings
1. Always ensure mutex guards are dropped before await points in async functions
2. Use block scoping `{ }` to control guard lifetimes
3. Wrap non-Send types in Arc<Mutex<>> when needed in async contexts
4. Clone is often easier than Arc for test structs
