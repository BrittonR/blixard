# MadSim-Tonic Integration Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to make the Raft comprehensive tests work with MadSim-tonic integration.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing tokio Features in madsim-tokio 0.2
- **Problem**: madsim-tokio 0.2 has limited API compared to regular tokio
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Removed `tokio::select!` usage - not available in madsim-tokio
  - Removed `tokio::sync::mpsc` - replaced with `std::sync::mpsc` where needed
  - Removed `tokio::time::interval` - replaced with sleep loops
  - Changed `tokio::spawn` to `madsim::task::spawn`

### 2. Import Path Errors
- **Problem**: Tests were using `crate::` imports which don't work in test context
- **Fix**: Changed all imports from `crate::` to `blixard_simulation::`

### 3. MadSim Client/Server Separation Requirements
- **Problem**: MadSim requires client and server to run on different simulated nodes
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Server runs on node with IP like `10.0.0.1`
  - Client runs on separate node with IP like `10.0.0.2` or `10.0.0.100`
  - Removed usage of `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`

### 4. Test Pattern Updates
All tests were updated to follow this working pattern:
```rust
#[madsim::test]
async fn test_name() {
    let handle = Handle::current();
    
    // Create server nodes
    for i in 1..=N {
        let server_node = handle.create_node()
            .name(format!("node-{}", i))
            .ip(format!("10.0.0.{}", i).parse().unwrap())
            .build();
        
        server_node.spawn(async move {
            // Server logic
        });
    }
    
    // Create client node for testing
    let client_node = handle.create_node()
        .name("test-client")
        .ip("10.0.0.100".parse().unwrap())
        .build();
    
    client_node.spawn(async move {
        // All test assertions and client logic
    }).await.unwrap();
}
```

### 5. Send Trait Issues
- **Problem**: `TestRaftNode::run()` holds mutex guards across await points, making it not Send
- **Workaround**: Commented out the Raft tick loop spawning with TODO note
- **Impact**: Tests that require actual consensus behavior will fail without the tick loop

## Test Results
- ✅ `test_leader_election_basic` - Passes (basic connectivity test)
- ❌ Other tests fail because they expect actual Raft consensus behavior

## Files Modified
- `simulation/tests/raft_comprehensive_tests.rs` - Main test file with all fixes
- No changes needed to `test_util.rs` beyond what was already there

## Lessons Learned
1. Always check MadSim API documentation for the specific version in use
2. Client/server must run on separate nodes in MadSim
3. Many tokio features are not available in madsim-tokio 0.2
4. Mutex guards across await points cause Send trait issues with spawn

## Next Steps
To make all tests pass:
1. Fix Send trait issues in `TestRaftNode` to allow tick loop
2. Or implement simpler mock consensus without complex async operations
3. Or use these as integration tests with real Raft implementation
