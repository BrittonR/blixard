## Current Test Results

### ✅ Passing Test Suites

All test suites are passing when run with `cargo nextest run`:

1. **Unit Tests** - All passing
   - CLI tests
   - Error tests  
   - Type tests
   - Storage tests
   - Node tests

2. **Property-Based Tests (PropTest)** - All passing
   - Error properties
   - Type properties
   - Node properties
   - Peer connector properties (including `test_concurrent_operations`)
   - Raft properties
   - Shared node state properties

3. **Integration Tests** - All passing
   - Cluster formation tests
   - Node lifecycle tests
   - Distributed storage tests
   - gRPC service tests
   - Peer management tests

4. **Performance Tests** - All passing
   - Storage performance benchmarks (including `benchmark_snapshot_transfer`)
   - Connection pool stress tests

## Previously Failing Test (Now Fixed)

### ✅ storage_edge_case_tests::test_large_state_transfer

**Previous Error**: `"Failed to add node: Node 4 already exists in cluster"`

**Root Cause**: Multiple issues were found and fixed:
1. `TestCluster::add_node()` was connecting to any node instead of the leader
2. Duplicate join detection was checking the peer list instead of Raft configuration
3. `TestCluster::add_node()` was sending join request twice (once in builder, once explicitly)

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Updated `add_node()` to find and connect through the current leader
2. Changed join duplicate detection to check Raft voters instead of peer list
3. Removed duplicate `send_join_request()` call in `add_node()`

**Current Status**: Test now passes. The warning about sync timeout is expected for large state transfers and doesn't affect test success.

## Compiler Warnings

A few minor warnings remain:

1. **Unused assignment**: `restart_count` in src/node.rs:159
2. **Unused imports**: Some test utilities in tests/common/
3. **Dead code**: Some test helper functions that are conditionally used

## Test Execution Notes

### Running Tests

```bash
# Recommended: Use cargo nextest for better isolation and reporting
cargo nextest run --all-features

# Traditional cargo test also works
cargo test --all-features

# Run specific test suites
cargo test --test storage_tests --features test-helpers
cargo test --test peer_connector_proptest
```

### Test Features

- `test-helpers`: Required for integration tests
- `simulation`: For MadSim deterministic tests (separate workspace)
- `failpoints`: For fault injection (prepared but not actively used)

## Recent Fixes Applied

1. **✅ Fixed**: peer_connector_proptest concurrent operations (was failing due to duplicate peer IDs)
2. **✅ Fixed**: storage_performance_benchmarks snapshot transfer (was failing due to proposal errors)  
3. **✅ Fixed**: Raft consensus enforcement across all state changes
4. **✅ Fixed**: Test reliability with condition-based waiting instead of sleep()
5. **✅ Fixed**: 5+ node cluster configuration handling

## Performance Observations

- Most tests complete in < 1 second
- Integration tests with clusters take 2-30 seconds
- Property tests with extensive iterations can take up to 100 seconds
- All tests complete within reasonable timeouts

## Recommendations

1. **Address the edge case test failure** - Fix node ID allocation for extreme scenarios
2. **Clean up compiler warnings** - Remove unused code and imports
3. **Consider test categorization** - Tag expensive tests for optional execution
4. **Monitor test execution times** - Some property tests are approaching timeout limits
