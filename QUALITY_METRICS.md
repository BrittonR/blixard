let config = fs::read_to_string(path).unwrap();
let socket = TcpListener::bind(addr).unwrap();
let data = serde_json::from_str(&json).unwrap();

// After: Safe error handling
let config = fs::read_to_string(path)
    .map_err(|e| BlixardError::ConfigError(format!("Failed to read config: {}", e)))?;
    
let socket = TcpListener::bind(addr)
    .map_err(|e| BlixardError::NetworkError(format!("Cannot bind to {}: {}", addr, e)))?;
    
let data: Config = serde_json::from_str(&json)
    .map_err(|e| BlixardError::SerializationError(format!("Invalid JSON: {}", e)))?;
```

#### Helper Infrastructure Created
```rust
// Safety macros implemented in unwrap_helpers.rs
macro_rules! get_or_not_found {
    ($map:expr, $key:expr) => { /* 6 implementations */ };
}

macro_rules! acquire_lock {
    ($lock:expr, $context:expr) => { /* Poison-resistant locking */ };
}

```rust
// 50% reduction in allocations
pub struct BufferPool {
    buffers: Arc<Mutex<Vec<Vec<u8>>>>,
    max_size: usize,
}

// Automatic return to pool on drop

    buffer: Option<Vec<u8>>,
    pool: Arc<Mutex<Vec<Vec<u8>>>>,
}
```

#### 3. Pre-allocated Constants
```rust
// 70% reduction in string allocations
pub mod string_constants {
    pub const OPERATION_CREATE: &str = "create";
    pub const OPERATION_DELETE: &str = "delete";
