# Transport Switching Implementation Summary

## Overview

Created automated test suite and infrastructure for switching between gRPC and Iroh P2P transports.

## Completed Work (todo #46) ✅

### 1. Test Suite Created
- `tests/transport_switching_test.rs` - Unit tests for transport configurations
- `tests/transport_migration_test.rs` - Integration tests for migration scenarios
- `scripts/test-transport-suite.sh` - Automated test runner

### 2. Migration Strategies Implemented

#### Immediate Migration
```rust
MigrationStrategy::Immediate
```
- Switch all traffic to Iroh at once
- Best for development/testing

#### Gradual Migration
```rust
MigrationStrategy::Gradual {
    start_percentage: 10,
    increment_per_hour: 5,
    target_percentage: 90,
}
```
- Slowly increase Iroh usage over time
- Monitor impact in production

#### Service-Based Migration
```rust
MigrationStrategy::ServiceBased {
    health: true,      // Use Iroh
    status: true,      // Use Iroh
    cluster: false,    // Keep on gRPC
    vm: false,        // Keep on gRPC
    task: false,      // Keep on gRPC
    monitoring: false, // Keep on gRPC
}
```
- Migrate specific services independently
- Test service by service

#### With Fallback
```rust
MigrationStrategy::WithFallback
```
- Try Iroh first, fall back to gRPC on failure
- Maximum availability

### 3. Documentation
- `docs/TRANSPORT_SWITCHING_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide for operators

## Test Coverage

### Configuration Tests ✅
- gRPC transport configuration
- Iroh transport configuration  
- Dual mode configuration
- Migration strategy validation
- Serialization/deserialization

### Migration Scenario Tests ✅
- Live cluster migration simulation
- Service-based migration
- Gradual percentage increase
- Error handling and fallback
- Performance monitoring
- Rollback capability
- Hot configuration reload
- Cross-transport compatibility

## Architecture

### Transport Abstraction Layer
```
Application Layer
       ↓
Service Interface (transport-agnostic)
       ↓
ClientFactory (routing decision)
    ↙     ↘
gRPC    Iroh
```

### Dual Mode Operation
- Both transports active simultaneously
- ClientFactory routes based on strategy
- Seamless failover capability
- No service disruption during migration

## Key Features

1. **Zero-downtime migration** - Switch transports without stopping services
2. **Granular control** - Per-service or percentage-based migration
3. **Automatic fallback** - Maintain availability if new transport fails
4. **Monitoring integration** - Track metrics during migration
5. **Rollback support** - Quickly revert if issues arise

## Usage

### Run Test Suite
```bash
./scripts/test-transport-suite.sh
```

### Configure Dual Mode
```toml
[transport]
type = "dual"

[transport.migration]
strategy = "gradual"
start_percentage = 0
```

### Monitor Migration
```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep transport_
```

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Enable dual mode in configuration
- [ ] Start with 0% Iroh traffic
- [ ] Monitor error rates and latency
- [ ] Gradually increase Iroh percentage
- [ ] Watch for connection issues
- [ ] Complete migration or rollback

## Benefits

1. **Risk Mitigation** - Test new transport safely
2. **Performance Validation** - Compare transports under real load
3. **Flexibility** - Multiple migration strategies
4. **Observability** - Full metrics during transition
5. **Reliability** - Automatic fallback on errors

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with production monitoring
2. Add A/B testing capabilities
3. Implement automatic rollback triggers
4. Create migration playbooks
5. Add transport-specific health checks
