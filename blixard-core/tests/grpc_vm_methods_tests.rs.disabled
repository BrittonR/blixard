//! Fixed gRPC VM operation tests with proper state verification
//!
//! These tests verify actual system behavior rather than just testing
//! that methods complete. They check state changes, error conditions,
//! and end-to-end workflows to ensure production reliability.
//!
//! DISABLED: These tests depend on the grpc_server module which has been removed.
//! The functionality is now provided through the transport module with Iroh integration.

#![cfg(feature = "test-helpers")]

// Original test code preserved for reference when re-implementing with new transport layer
