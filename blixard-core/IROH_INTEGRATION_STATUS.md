# Iroh Integration Status

## Summary

We have successfully implemented a custom Iroh RPC protocol and integrated it with the dual service runner. The implementation provides a foundation for gradually migrating services from gRPC to Iroh.

## Completed Components

### 1. Custom Iroh RPC Protocol (`iroh_protocol.rs`)
- Binary protocol with efficient framing
- Message header with version, type, length, and request ID
- Support for request/response pattern
- Extensible for streaming (StreamData, StreamEnd message types)
- Serialization using bincode for efficiency

### 2. Service Framework (`iroh_service.rs`)
- `IrohService` trait for implementing services
- `ServiceRegistry` for managing multiple services
- `IrohRpcServer` that accepts connections and routes to services
- `IrohRpcClient` with connection pooling
- Async-first design using tokio

### 3. Implemented Services
- **Health Service** (`iroh_health_service.rs`)
  - Methods: `check` (returns health status) and `ping`
  - Client wrapper for easy usage
- **Status Service** (`iroh_status_service.rs`)
  - Methods: `get_cluster_status` and `get_raft_status`
  - Reuses existing StatusServiceImpl logic

### 4. Dual Service Runner Integration (`dual_service_runner.rs`)
- Updated to support three modes:
  - **gRPC-only**: All services via gRPC
  - **Iroh-only**: All services via Iroh RPC
  - **Dual mode**: Services split based on migration strategy
- Migration strategy allows gradual service migration
- Services can be individually configured to use either transport

### 5. Configuration (`config.rs`)
- Enhanced `TransportConfig` enum with three modes
- `MigrationStrategy` with service-level transport preferences
- Support for fallback behavior
- Flexible configuration for production deployment

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Gradual Migration**: Services can be migrated one at a time
2. **Protocol Independence**: Service implementations are transport-agnostic
3. **Performance**: Binary protocol with minimal overhead
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new services or modify existing ones
5. **Testing**: Can test services independently of transport

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. Fix compilation errors in the broader codebase
2. Implement VM service over Iroh
3. Add integration tests with actual Iroh endpoints
4. Update client factory to support Iroh transport

### Medium Term
1. Implement Raft message transport over Iroh
2. Add connection health monitoring
3. Implement retry logic and circuit breakers
4. Add metrics for Iroh RPC performance

### Long Term
1. Migrate all services to Iroh
2. Remove gRPC dependencies (once stable)
3. Optimize protocol for specific use cases
4. Add advanced features (streaming, server push, etc.)

## Technical Decisions

### Why Custom RPC Instead of tonic-iroh-transport?
After investigation, we chose to implement a custom RPC protocol because:
- `tonic-iroh-transport` had compatibility issues with our iroh version
- Custom protocol gives us more control over the wire format
- Simpler implementation that meets our specific needs
- Can optimize for our use cases (e.g., Raft messages)

### Protocol Design Choices
- **Binary format**: More efficient than JSON/text
- **Fixed header**: Easy to parse and validate
- **Request IDs**: Enable request/response correlation
- **Versioning**: Future compatibility
- **Size limits**: Prevent DoS attacks

## Code Examples

### Starting a Dual-Mode Server
```rust
let config = TransportConfig::Dual {
    grpc_config: GrpcConfig::default(),
    iroh_config: IrohConfig::default(),
    strategy: MigrationStrategy {
        prefer_iroh_for: vec![ServiceType::Health].into_iter().collect(),
        ..Default::default()
    },
};

let runner = DualServiceRunner::new(node, config, grpc_addr, Some(iroh_endpoint));
runner.serve_non_critical_services().await?;
```

### Making an Iroh RPC Call
```rust
let client = IrohRpcClient::new(endpoint);
let health_client = IrohHealthClient::new(&client, node_addr);
let response = health_client.check().await?;
println!("Health: {}", response.status);
```

## Known Issues

1. **Compilation Errors**: The broader codebase has various compilation issues unrelated to the Iroh integration
2. **Endpoint Creation**: Need to verify the correct way to create Iroh endpoints in v0.90
3. **Testing**: Integration tests need actual Iroh endpoints, which may require additional setup

## Conclusion

The Iroh integration provides a solid foundation for P2P communication in Blixard. The custom RPC protocol is simple, efficient, and flexible enough to support our needs. With the dual service runner, we can gradually migrate services while maintaining compatibility and stability.
