# P2P Implementation Status with Iroh 0.90

## Current Status (2025-01-26)

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Updated dependencies to iroh 0.90**
   - iroh = "0.90"
   - iroh-blobs = "0.90"
   - iroh-docs = { git = "https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-docs", branch = "Frando/iroh-0.90" }

2. **Created IrohTransportV2** (`src/iroh_transport_v2.rs`)
   - Working implementation with iroh 0.90 API
   - Basic endpoint creation and P2P connectivity
   - Simplified document operations (in-memory storage)
   - File sharing with blake3 hashing
   - Compiles successfully with no errors

3. **Working Features**
   - Endpoint creation with node ID generation
   - NodeAddr retrieval with direct addresses
   - Document creation and key-value storage (in-memory)
   - Basic file hashing for sharing
   - Peer-to-peer connection establishment
   - Unidirectional stream communication

### üöß In Progress
1. **Blob Storage Integration**
   - Need to integrate with iroh-blobs properly
   - Current implementation only computes hashes
   - Download functionality not implemented

2. **Document Synchronization**
   - Currently using in-memory HashMap
   - Need to integrate with iroh-docs for real sync
   - Waiting for stable API in iroh-docs 0.90 branch

### ‚ùå Not Implemented
1. **Real Blob Store**
   - File chunks and distribution
   - Blob retrieval from peers

2. **Document Replication**
   - Sync between peers
   - Conflict resolution

3. **Discovery Integration**
   - DNS discovery
   - mDNS discovery
   - Static peer configuration

## Architecture Notes

The new implementation (`IrohTransportV2`) uses a simplified approach that works with iroh 0.90:

1. **Direct Endpoint Usage** - No complex Router setup needed for basic functionality
2. **In-Memory Storage** - Temporarily using HashMap for documents until iroh-docs API stabilizes
3. **Blake3 Hashing** - Using blake3 directly for file hashing
4. **ALPN-based Routing** - Using document types as ALPN identifiers

## Next Steps

1. **Test Integration**
   - Update P2pManager to use IrohTransportV2
   - Fix P2pImageStore initialization
   - Enable VM image distribution

2. **Blob Storage**
   - Research iroh-blobs 0.90 API for proper integration
   - Implement chunked file transfer
   - Add progress tracking

3. **Production Features**
   - Add peer discovery
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add metrics and monitoring

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
cargo test --lib iroh_transport_v2::tests
```

Current test status:
- ‚úÖ test_iroh_transport_v2_creation
- ‚úÖ test_document_operations
- ‚úÖ test_file_operations
- ‚úÖ test_peer_communication (connection may fail in test env)
