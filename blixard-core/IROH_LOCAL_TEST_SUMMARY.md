# Iroh Local Testing Summary

## Successfully Completed Local Testing âœ…

### What Was Tested

1. **Basic Connectivity** (`iroh_basic_test.rs`)
   - Two Iroh endpoints connecting with ALPN protocol matching
   - Bidirectional stream establishment
   - Request/response message exchange
   - Proper stream lifecycle management

2. **Three-Node Cluster** (`iroh_three_node_test.rs`)
   - Multi-node P2P mesh network
   - Each node can connect to any other node
   - Concurrent connection handling
   - Message broadcasting capabilities
   - Acknowledgment system

### Key Achievements

1. **Working P2P Communication**
   - Iroh endpoints successfully create QUIC connections
   - Custom binary protocol (`MessageType`, `MessageHeader`) works correctly
   - Message serialization/deserialization functioning properly

2. **Multi-Node Capabilities**
   - Nodes can form a mesh network
   - No central coordinator required
   - Direct peer-to-peer communication

3. **Protocol Implementation**
   - 24-byte efficient message headers
   - Request/Response message types
   - Stream-based communication model

### Test Results

```
âœ“ Basic connectivity: PASSED
âœ“ Message exchange: PASSED
âœ“ Multi-node mesh: PASSED
âœ“ Concurrent connections: PASSED
âœ“ Protocol handling: PASSED
```

### Example Output

```
Test 1: Node 1 â†’ Node 2
  â†’ Received ACK from Node 2
  âœ“ Node 2 received: Hello from Node 1 to Node 2!

Test 2: Node 2 â†’ Node 3
  â†’ Received ACK from Node 3
  âœ“ Node 3 received: Hello from Node 2 to Node 3!

Test 3: Node 3 â†’ Node 1
  â†’ Received ACK from Node 1
  âœ“ Node 1 received: Hello from Node 3 to Node 1!
```

### Files Created

1. `examples/iroh_basic_test.rs` - Basic two-node connectivity test
2. `examples/iroh_three_node_test.rs` - Three-node mesh network test
3. `examples/iroh_simple_cluster.rs` - (Attempted RPC service test - needs more work)

### Next Steps

1. âœ… **Local multi-node testing** - COMPLETE
2. ðŸ”„ **Integration tests** - In progress (todo #38)
3. ðŸ“‹ **NAT traversal testing** - Pending (todo #44)
4. ðŸ“‹ **Raft consensus validation** - Pending (todo #45)

### Technical Notes

- ALPN protocol must match between endpoints (`blixard/1`)
- Endpoints bind to random ports automatically
- Direct addresses are immediately available via `bound_sockets()`
- Stream closure after writing is expected behavior
- Concurrent accept loops handle multiple connections

## Conclusion

The Iroh transport layer is functioning correctly for local multi-node communication. The P2P mesh network capabilities are validated and ready for further integration with the Blixard services layer.
