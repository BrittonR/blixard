### üöÄ Ready for Phase 6: Production Rollout

#### Canary Deployment Plan

**Week 1-2: Initial Canary (5% of nodes)**
```toml
[transport]
mode = "dual"

[transport.migration]
prefer_iroh = ["health", "status"]
raft_transport = "grpc"
fallback_to_grpc = true
```

**Week 3-4: Expanded Canary (25% of nodes)**
```toml
[transport.migration]
prefer_iroh = ["health", "status", "monitoring", "vm_ops"]
raft_transport = "grpc"
```

**Week 5-6: Majority Migration (50% of nodes)**
```toml
[transport.migration]
prefer_iroh = ["all_except_raft"]
raft_transport = "adaptive"
```

**Week 7-8: Full Migration (100% of nodes)**
```toml
[transport]
mode = "iroh"
```

### üìä Monitoring Requirements

#### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Connection Metrics**
   - Connection establishment time (P50, P95, P99)
   - Active connections per node
   - Connection failures and retries
   - NAT traversal success rate

2. **Message Metrics**
   - Message latency by type
   - Throughput (messages/sec, bytes/sec)
   - Message failures and retries
   - Queue depths

3. **Raft Specific**
   - Election stability
   - Heartbeat latency
   - Log replication speed
   - Leader changes frequency

4. **Resource Usage**
   - CPU usage comparison (gRPC vs Iroh)
   - Memory usage
   - Network bandwidth
   - File descriptor usage

### üõ°Ô∏è Rollback Strategy

1. **Configuration-based Rollback**
   ```toml
   # Emergency rollback
   [transport]
   mode = "grpc"
   ```

2. **Gradual Rollback**
   - Revert canary nodes first
   - Monitor for 24 hours
   - Proceed with remaining nodes

3. **Dual Mode Safety Net**
   - Both transports remain available
   - Automatic fallback on errors
   - No code changes required

### üìã Pre-Production Checklist

- [x] Code review complete
- [x] Performance benchmarks documented
- [x] Migration plan reviewed
- [x] Rollback procedure tested
- [x] Monitoring dashboards prepared
- [ ] Operations team trained
- [ ] Runbooks updated
- [ ] Customer communication prepared

### üéØ Success Criteria

1. **Week 1 Canary**
   - No increase in error rates
   - P99 latency within 10% of baseline
   - Zero unplanned rollbacks

2. **Week 4 (25% deployment)**
   - NAT traversal working for 95%+ connections
   - Connection stability maintained
   - Resource usage acceptable

3. **Week 8 (Full deployment)**
   - All nodes on Iroh transport
   - Improved operational metrics
   - Positive feedback from operations team

### üìù Next Steps

1. **Begin Canary Deployment**
   - Select 5% of nodes for initial rollout
   - Configure dual transport mode
   - Enable enhanced monitoring

2. **Daily Monitoring**
   - Review metrics dashboards
   - Check error logs
   - Monitor customer feedback

3. **Weekly Reviews**
   - Assess rollout progress
   - Make go/no-go decisions
   - Update stakeholders

## Conclusion

The Iroh P2P transport is production-ready with excellent performance characteristics and a safe migration path. The dual-transport architecture allows for gradual rollout with easy rollback, minimizing risk while maximizing the benefits of the new transport layer.
