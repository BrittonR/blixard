# gRPC Example Files Cleanup Summary

## Files Deleted (Pure gRPC Examples)
These files were completely removed as they demonstrated pure gRPC functionality:
- `cedar_grpc_integration.rs` - gRPC middleware example with Cedar authorization
- `create_microvm.rs` - gRPC client example for creating MicroVMs
- `create_vm_with_ssh.rs` - gRPC client example for creating VMs with SSH
- `stop_vm.rs` - gRPC client example for stopping VMs

## Files Disabled (Potentially Convertible)
These files were renamed with `.disabled` extension as they might be useful to convert to Iroh-only:
- `dual_transport_demo.rs.disabled` - Demonstrated both gRPC and Iroh transports
- `iroh_raft_transport_demo.rs.disabled` - Compared Raft over gRPC vs Iroh
- `raft_transport_comparison.rs.disabled` - Benchmarked both transport types
- `transport_latency_test.rs.disabled` - Tested latency for both transports
- `test_raft_transport.rs.disabled` - Basic transport functionality tests

## Files Kept (Iroh-focused)
All remaining `.rs` files in the examples directory are now Iroh-focused without gRPC dependencies.

## Next Steps
To fully convert the disabled files to Iroh-only:
1. Remove all gRPC/tonic imports and dependencies
2. Remove gRPC-specific configuration and setup code
3. Update benchmarks to focus on Iroh performance characteristics
4. Update documentation to reflect Iroh-only architecture
