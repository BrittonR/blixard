# gRPC Test Removal Summary

This document summarizes the actions taken to remove or disable gRPC-related test files in the tests/ directory.

## Files Deleted (2 files)
These files were purely testing gRPC functionality and had no value without gRPC:

1. **tests/grpc_comprehensive_tests.rs** - Comprehensive gRPC testing suite covering streaming, deadlines, metadata, etc.
2. **tests/peer_connector_tests.rs** - Tests for gRPC peer connections and message delivery

## Files Disabled (12 files)
These files were renamed with .disabled extension as they might be useful to convert later:

1. **tests/cedar_grpc_integration_test.rs.disabled** - Cedar authorization with gRPC services
2. **tests/chaos_testing.rs.disabled** - Chaos testing that uses gRPC client calls for distributed behavior testing
3. **tests/grpc_metrics_test.rs.disabled** - Tests metrics collection through gRPC operations
4. **tests/auth_integration_test.rs.disabled** - Authentication layer tests using tonic/tower
5. **tests/connection_pool_metrics_test.rs.disabled** - Connection pool metrics for gRPC connections
6. **tests/large_cluster_tests.rs.disabled** - Large cluster scalability tests using gRPC clients
7. **tests/iroh_dual_transport_test.rs.disabled** - Tests both gRPC and Iroh transports together
8. **tests/security_integration_tests.rs.disabled** - Security tests using gRPC middleware
9. **tests/transport_switching_test.rs.disabled** - Tests switching between gRPC and Iroh
10. **tests/transport_migration_test.rs.disabled** - Tests live migration from gRPC to Iroh
11. **tests/network_partition_tests.rs.disabled** - Network partition tests using gRPC proto types
12. **tests/test_cluster_status.rs.disabled** - Cluster status tests using gRPC proto and tonic
13. **tests/iroh_custom_rpc_test.rs.disabled** - Iroh RPC tests that use gRPC proto types

## Files Kept (Active Tests)
These files were kept as they don't depend on gRPC or test Iroh-only functionality:

- **tests/send_sync_test.rs** - Tests Send+Sync traits, no gRPC dependency
- **tests/default_transport_test.rs** - Tests that Iroh is the default transport
- **tests/raft_codec_tests.rs** - Tests Raft serialization used by both transports
- **tests/metrics_server_test.rs** - Tests metrics server, mentions gRPC metrics but doesn't use gRPC
- **tests/iroh_default_integration_test.rs** - Tests Iroh as default transport
- **tests/iroh_transport_integration_test.rs** - Pure Iroh transport integration tests
- **tests/node_tests.rs** - Node lifecycle tests (need to verify this doesn't use gRPC)

## Migration Strategy

The disabled tests fall into several categories:

1. **Worth Converting**: 
   - chaos_testing.rs - Valuable distributed system tests
   - large_cluster_tests.rs - Important scalability tests
   - network_partition_tests.rs - Critical for distributed systems

2. **Transport-Specific**:
   - iroh_dual_transport_test.rs - May be useful if dual transport is re-implemented
   - transport_switching_test.rs - Useful if transport migration is needed
   - transport_migration_test.rs - Useful for live migration scenarios

3. **Infrastructure Tests**:
   - auth_integration_test.rs - Needs Iroh-based auth implementation
   - security_integration_tests.rs - Needs Iroh-based security
   - cedar_grpc_integration_test.rs - Needs Iroh-based Cedar integration

4. **Metrics/Monitoring**:
   - grpc_metrics_test.rs - Convert to test Iroh metrics
   - connection_pool_metrics_test.rs - Convert for Iroh connection pooling
