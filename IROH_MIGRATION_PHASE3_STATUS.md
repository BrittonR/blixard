# Iroh Migration Phase 3 Status

## Overview

Phase 3 focuses on migrating VM operations to the dual-transport infrastructure, leveraging Iroh's P2P capabilities for VM image distribution while maintaining backward compatibility with gRPC.

## Completed Components

### 1. VM Service Implementation (`src/transport/services/vm.rs`)

Created a comprehensive VM service that supports both gRPC and Iroh transports:

#### Core Features:
- **Transport-agnostic VM operations**: Create, start, stop, delete, list, status, migrate
- **VmService trait**: Clean abstraction for VM lifecycle management
- **Serializable request/response types**: For Iroh protocol communication
- **Full gRPC compatibility**: Implements ClusterService trait
- **Metrics integration**: Tracks all VM operations

#### VM Operations Supported:
```rust
pub enum VmOperationRequest {
    Create { name, vcpus, memory_mb },
    Start { name },
    Stop { name },
    Delete { name },
    List,
    GetStatus { name },
    Migrate { vm_name, target_node_id, live_migration, force },
}
```

### 2. VM Image Service (`src/transport/services/vm_image.rs`)

Implements P2P VM image sharing using Iroh's blob transfer capabilities:

#### Key Features:
- **P2P image distribution**: Share VM images across the cluster
- **Content-addressed storage**: SHA256 hash-based image identification
- **Metadata support**: Attach custom metadata to images
- **Local caching**: Efficient image retrieval from cache
- **Progress tracking**: Monitor transfer status

#### Image Operations:
```rust
pub enum VmImageOperation {
    Share { image_name, image_path, version, metadata },
    Get { image_name, version, image_hash },
    List,
}
```

### 3. Integration with Existing P2P Infrastructure

The VM services leverage the existing P2P components:
- **P2pManager**: Handles peer connections and resource transfers
- **P2pImageStore**: Manages local image cache and metadata
- **IrohTransport**: Provides underlying blob transfer capabilities

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Unified VM Management
- Single interface for VM operations regardless of transport
- Seamless migration path from gRPC to Iroh
- Consistent error handling and metrics

### 2. Efficient Image Distribution
- P2P transfer reduces bandwidth requirements
- Content addressing ensures image integrity
- Local caching minimizes redundant transfers

### 3. Migration Flexibility
- VMs can be created via gRPC and images fetched via Iroh
- Gradual migration based on operation type
- Fallback support for reliability

## Implementation Details

### VM Service Flow
1. **Request Reception**: Via gRPC or Iroh transport
2. **Validation**: Check permissions and quotas
3. **Raft Consensus**: All state changes go through Raft
4. **Execution**: VM backend performs the operation
5. **Response**: Success/failure with appropriate metadata

### Image Transfer Flow
1. **Share Request**: Upload image to Iroh blob store
2. **Hash Calculation**: Generate content hash for verification
3. **Metadata Storage**: Store image info in P2pImageStore
4. **Discovery**: Other nodes can list available images
5. **Retrieval**: Download images on demand with caching

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 3A: VM Operations (Current)
- ✅ VM lifecycle operations over dual transport
- ✅ Maintain full gRPC compatibility
- ✅ Metrics for both transports

### Phase 3B: Image Transfer (Current)
- ✅ P2P image sharing implementation
- ✅ Integration with existing P2P manager
- ✅ Content-addressed storage

### Phase 3C: Integration (Next Steps)
- ⏳ Connect VM creation with P2P image retrieval
- ⏳ Implement image pre-fetching for migrations
- ⏳ Add image garbage collection

## Configuration Example

```toml
[transport]
mode = "dual"

[transport.grpc]
bind_address = "0.0.0.0:7001"
max_message_size = 4194304

[transport.iroh]
enabled = true
home_relay = "https://relay.iroh.network"
alpn_protocols = ["blixard/vm/1", "blixard/vm-image/1"]

[transport.strategy]
prefer_iroh_for = ["health", "status", "monitoring", "vm_ops", "vm_images"]
raft_transport = "always_grpc"
fallback_to_grpc = true

[p2p]
enable_image_sharing = true
image_cache_dir = "/var/lib/blixard/images"
max_cache_size_gb = 100
```

## Performance Considerations

### VM Operations
- **Latency**: Iroh adds minimal overhead for control operations
- **Throughput**: Similar to gRPC for small request/response
- **Reliability**: QUIC provides better handling of packet loss

### Image Transfers
- **Bandwidth**: P2P distribution reduces backbone traffic
- **Speed**: Parallel transfers from multiple peers
- **Efficiency**: Delta transfers for image updates (future)

## Security Considerations

1. **Image Verification**: SHA256 hashes ensure integrity
2. **Access Control**: Same permission model as gRPC
3. **Transport Security**: QUIC provides encryption by default
4. **Metadata Privacy**: Sensitive data should not be in metadata

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- VM service operations with mock backends
- Image service with mock P2P manager
- Protocol serialization/deserialization

### Integration Tests
- Dual transport VM operations
- P2P image transfer scenarios
- Fallback behavior testing

### Performance Tests
- Image transfer benchmarks
- VM operation latency comparison
- Concurrent operation stress tests

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete Iroh protocol handlers for VM operations
2. Implement VM image pre-fetching
3. Add progress tracking for image transfers
4. Create integration tests

### Future Enhancements
1. **Delta Image Updates**: Transfer only changed blocks
2. **Image Deduplication**: Share common layers between images
3. **Predictive Caching**: Pre-fetch images based on patterns
4. **Multi-region Support**: Optimize transfers across regions

## Known Limitations

1. **Protocol Handlers**: Currently placeholders, need implementation
2. **Progress Tracking**: Basic implementation, needs enhancement
3. **Error Recovery**: Needs more sophisticated retry logic
4. **Image GC**: No automatic cleanup of old images yet

## Conclusion

Phase 3 successfully extends the dual-transport architecture to VM operations, leveraging Iroh's P2P capabilities for efficient image distribution. The implementation maintains full backward compatibility while providing a clear migration path. The separation of VM control operations from image transfers allows for flexible deployment strategies and optimal use of each transport's strengths.
