- `build.rs` - Protocol buffer compilation
- `flake.nix` - Nix development environment

## Development Guidelines

### Core Rules
1. Follow existing error handling patterns in `src/error.rs`
2. Use structured types from `src/types.rs`
3. Implement gRPC services according to `proto/blixard.proto`
4. Maintain CLI consistency with the patterns in `src/main.rs`

### Architecture Principles
- Runtime abstraction for testability
- Comprehensive error handling with context
- Type-safe configuration and state management
- Clean separation between CLI, library, and protocol layers

### Debugging Distributed Systems Issues

When debugging complex distributed systems issues (especially Raft/consensus problems), follow this systematic approach:

1. **Start with Official Documentation**
   - Check the library's official docs first (e.g., https://docs.rs/raft/latest/raft/)
   - Review canonical examples from the library repository
   - Look for similar issues in the library's GitHub issues

2. **Create a Debugging Document**
   - Create a `*_DEBUG.md` file to track the investigation
   - Document each hypothesis and test result
   - Include relevant log outputs and error messages
   - Add external references and documentation links

3. **Systematic Investigation**
   - Start with the simplest test case (e.g., single node before multi-node)
   - Add extensive logging at key points
   - Check assumptions about library behavior
   - Compare your implementation with working examples

4. **Common Raft Debugging Patterns**
   - Verify initial configuration and bootstrap process
   - Check ready state processing loops
   - Ensure proper handling of committed vs applied indices
   - Verify message serialization/deserialization
   - Check for timing issues in single-node vs multi-node scenarios

5. **Document Failed Attempts**
   - Keep track of what doesn't work and why
   - This prevents repeating the same attempts
   - Helps identify patterns in the failures

### Enhanced Todo Usage for Complex Tasks

When working on complex debugging or multi-step implementation:

1. **Create Hypothesis-Based Todos**
   - Each todo should represent a testable hypothesis
   - Include expected outcome in the todo description
   - Example: "Check if Raft entries are committed in single-node - expect commit index > 0"

2. **Track Investigation Results**
   - Update todo descriptions with findings
   - Mark as completed even if hypothesis was wrong
   - Create follow-up todos based on results

3. **Maintain Context Across Sessions**
   - Use todos to record current understanding
   - Include references to relevant files/lines
   - Note which approaches have been tried

4. **Example Debugging Todo Structure**
   ```
   - [ ] Review library examples for single-node bootstrap pattern
   - [ ] Test if adding empty proposal after bootstrap helps
   - [ ] Check if applied index needs different initialization
   - [ ] Compare our ready loop with canonical example
   ```

### Test-Driven Debugging

When debugging issues, use tests to guide your investigation:

1. **Start with Minimal Reproduction**
   - Create the smallest possible test that reproduces the issue
   - Test single components before testing integration
   - Use `--nocapture` to see all output during test runs

2. **Interpret Test Output Systematically**
   - Look for patterns in test failures
   - Use grep/rg to filter relevant log lines
   - Pay attention to timing and ordering of events
   - Save test outputs for comparison across attempts

3. **Create Focused Test Cases**
   - Write specific tests for each hypothesis
   - Use property-based tests to find edge cases
   - Add logging/tracing to existing tests rather than only adding new tests

4. **Test Output as Investigation Guide**
   ```bash
   # Example: Filter and analyze test output
   cargo test test_name --features test-helpers -- --nocapture 2>&1 | grep -E "pattern1|pattern2" | tail -50
   
   # Save outputs for comparison
   cargo test > output1.log 2>&1
   # Make changes
   cargo test > output2.log 2>&1
   diff output1.log output2.log
   ```

## Recently Fixed Issues

1. **Three-Node Cluster Formation** (âœ… FULLY FIXED)
   - Fixed: Configuration state persistence after applying changes
   - Fixed: Storage initialization for joining nodes
   - Fixed: Message buffering during peer connection establishment
   - Fixed: Peer discovery - joining nodes now learn about the leader
   - Fixed: Replication triggering after configuration changes
   - Fixed: Raft panic "not leader but has new msg after advance"
   - Fixed: Leader detection in SharedNodeState
   - Basic three-node cluster test now passes reliably
   - See `THREE_NODE_CLUSTER_DEBUG.md` for detailed investigation and solutions

2. **Database Persistence Test Cleanup** (âœ… FIXED)
   - Fixed: Database file locking issues during node restarts
   - Fixed: Incomplete component shutdown leaving database references
   - Fixed: Property tests using hardcoded paths instead of temporary directories
   - Solution: Added `shutdown_components()` method to properly clean up all database references
   - Solution: Updated `stop()` method to ensure complete shutdown with file lock release
   - Test `test_database_persistence_across_restarts` now passes consistently

3. **Test-Helpers Feature Compilation** (âœ… FIXED)
   - Fixed: Three-node cluster tests failing to compile due to missing test-helpers feature
   - Fixed: Integration tests couldn't access `test_helpers` module
   - Solution: Added `#![cfg(feature = "test-helpers")]` to test files
   - Solution: Configured example to require feature in Cargo.toml
   - Tests must be run with `--features test-helpers` flag

4. **PropTest Failures and Node Lifecycle** (âœ… FIXED)
   - Fixed: `test_vm_commands_across_node_states` expecting VM commands to work after `stop()`
   - Fixed: `test_cluster_operations_uninitialized` expecting some operations to succeed
   - Solution: Added `is_initialized` state tracking to `SharedNodeState`
   - Solution: Added initialization checks to `join_cluster()`, `leave_cluster()`, and `get_cluster_status()`
   - Solution: Set `is_initialized` to true at the end of `Node::initialize()`
   - Design clarification: `stop()` is a complete shutdown, not a pause - clears all components to release resources
   - All PropTest suites now pass reliably

## Known Test Reliability Issues

See `TEST_RELIABILITY_ISSUES.md` for full details. Major issues:

1. **Three-node cluster tests are flaky** - Timing-dependent convergence issues
2. **25+ hardcoded sleep() calls** - Should use condition-based waiting
3. **Test workarounds required** - E.g., sending health checks to trigger log replication
4. **~70-90% test reliability** - Tests may fail intermittently under load

When working on tests:
- Use `test_helpers::TestNode` and `TestCluster` abstractions
- Use `timing::wait_for_condition_with_backoff()` instead of `sleep()`
- All tests are enabled - fix failures rather than disabling tests
- Be aware that multi-node tests may fail intermittently

## Future Implementation Areas

Based on the current foundation, the following areas need implementation:
1. **Multi-Node Clustering** - Debug remaining join request processing issues
2. **VM Orchestration** - MicroVM lifecycle management via microvm.nix
3. **Log Compaction** - Implement Raft log compaction using snapshot infrastructure
4. **Metrics & Observability** - Performance monitoring and tracing
5. **Network Partition Handling** - Production-grade fault tolerance
6. **Dynamic Membership** - Safe cluster reconfiguration

## AI Development Guidelines

### What to Build On
- Use existing error types from `src/error.rs`
- Follow CLI patterns from `src/main.rs`
- Implement gRPC services per `proto/blixard.proto`
- Use domain types from `src/types.rs`
- Extend storage functionality in `src/storage.rs`
- Add VM operations to `src/vm_manager.rs`

### What AI Must NEVER Do
- Change the gRPC protocol without approval
- Remove existing error handling patterns
- Alter the CLI structure without discussion
- Commit secrets or configuration files with sensitive data

### External Reference Usage

When working with external libraries and debugging issues:

1. **Consult Documentation Early**
   - Check official docs before implementing features
   - Review library examples before writing code
   - Look for migration guides when updating dependencies

2. **Reference Canonical Implementations**
   - Study how the library authors use their own code
   - Check test files in the library repository
   - Look for production usage in well-known projects

3. **Include References in Code and Docs**
   - Add links to relevant documentation in comments
   - Include example references in debugging documents
   - Link to specific versions to avoid confusion with API changes

4. **Common External References for This Project**
   - Raft: https://docs.rs/raft/latest/raft/
   - Raft Examples: https://github.com/tikv/raft-rs/tree/master/examples
   - Tonic/gRPC: https://docs.rs/tonic/
   - MadSim: https://docs.rs/madsim/latest/madsim/

### Error Handling Pattern
```rust
use crate::error::{BlixardError, BlixardResult};

fn example_operation() -> BlixardResult<String> {
    // Use structured error types with context
    Err(BlixardError::NotImplemented {
        feature: "example operation".to_string(),
    })
}
```

### Commit Messages for Debugging Work

When committing debugging efforts that don't result in a complete fix:

1. **Structure for Investigation Commits**
   ```
   debug(component): investigate issue description
   
   - What was tried
   - What was discovered
   - What didn't work and why
   - Next steps to try
   
   Created ISSUE_DEBUG.md to track investigation
   References: [relevant docs/issues]
   ```

2. **Document Partial Progress**
   - Use `debug:` or `wip:` prefix for investigation commits
   - Always reference the debugging document created
   - Include external references consulted

3. **Example Debugging Commit**
   ```
   debug(raft): investigate cluster formation timeout
   
   Attempted fixes:
   - Fixed protobuf serialization for Raft messages
   - Added timeout handling for conf changes
   - Enhanced ready state processing
   
   Findings:
