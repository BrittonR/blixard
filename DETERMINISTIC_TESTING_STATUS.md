# Deterministic Testing Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed

1. **Runtime Abstractions** (`src/runtime.rs`)
   - Clock, Random, FileSystem, Network traits defined
   - Real implementations for production use

2. **Simulation Infrastructure** (`src/runtime/simulation.rs`)
   - SimulatedClock with time control
   - SimulatedNetwork with partition/latency injection
   - SimulatedFileSystem (in-memory)
   - Basic deterministic executor structure

3. **Failpoints Added**
   - Raft operations: proposal, message handling, sending
   - Storage operations: append entries
   - Network operations: send, connect

4. **Test Structure** (`tests/simulation_test.rs`)
   - Basic test scenarios written
   - Network partition tests
   - Failpoint injection tests

## ❌ Still Needed for True Deterministic Testing

### 1. **Production Code Integration**
The production code (RaftNode, Network, Storage) still uses tokio directly instead of the runtime abstraction:
- Need to pass Runtime trait to all components
- Replace `tokio::time::sleep` with `runtime.clock().sleep()`
- Replace `tokio::spawn` with `runtime.spawn()`
- Replace direct file I/O with `runtime.file_system()`

### 2. **Deterministic Executor**
Current implementation still uses tokio's runtime:
- Need to implement custom executor that controls task scheduling
- Ensure all async operations go through the deterministic executor
- Control the order of task execution for reproducibility

### 3. **Test Assertions**
Current tests don't verify behavior:
- Add checks for cluster formation (leader election)
- Verify partition behavior (minority can't write)
- Check log consistency after partition healing
- Validate failpoint effects

### 4. **Seed-based Reproducibility**
- Ensure all randomness uses the seeded RNG
- Record and replay failing test cases
- Verify same seed produces identical execution

## Example of What's Missing

Current code:
```rust
// In raft_node.rs
let mut ticker = tokio::time::interval(tokio::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
```

Should be:
```rust
// In raft_node.rs
let mut ticker = self.runtime.clock().interval(Duration::from_millis(100));
```

## Recommendation

To achieve true deterministic simulation testing like TigerBeetle/FoundationDB:

1. Start with a single component (e.g., just the Raft module)
2. Fully integrate the runtime abstraction
3. Write tests that actually verify behavior
4. Gradually expand to other components

The foundation is in place, but significant refactoring of production code is needed to actually use it.
