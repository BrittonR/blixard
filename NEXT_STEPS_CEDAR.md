# Next Steps for Cedar Authorization System

## Current Status

We've successfully completed:
1. ✅ Cedar foundation with schema and policies
2. ✅ Integration into SecurityManager and GrpcMiddleware
3. ✅ Updated all gRPC services to use Cedar (Phase 4)
4. ✅ Iroh transport support with Cedar authorization
5. ✅ Certificate-based enrollment for automatic node registration

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Testing and Validation (Phase 5 continuation)
- **Policy Validation Tests**: Ensure all Cedar policies are syntactically correct and conflict-free
- **Authorization Scenario Tests**: Comprehensive tests for multi-tenancy, quotas, time-based access
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Compare Cedar vs traditional RBAC performance
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test complex authorization scenarios

### 2. Migration Tools (Phase 6)
- **Role Migration Tool**: Convert existing RBAC data to Cedar entities
- **Policy Management CLI**: Add Cedar-specific commands to blixard CLI
- **Bulk User Import**: Support for importing users from LDAP/AD
- **Audit Trail Migration**: Convert existing audit logs to Cedar format

### 3. Advanced Cedar Features
- **Policy Templates**: Reusable policy patterns for common scenarios
- **Dynamic Policies**: Runtime policy updates without restart
- **Policy Versioning**: Track policy changes over time
- **Policy Analytics**: Understand which policies are most/least used

### 4. Production Readiness
- **Shadow Mode**: Run Cedar alongside existing RBAC to compare decisions
- **Gradual Rollout**: Feature flags for per-tenant Cedar enablement
- **Monitoring**: Cedar-specific metrics and alerts
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize policy evaluation for large deployments

### 5. Integration Enhancements
- **Identity Providers**: SAML, OIDC integration for external auth
- **Cloud IAM**: Map AWS/GCP/Azure identities to Cedar principals
- **Kubernetes**: Cedar policies for K8s resource authorization
- **Service Mesh**: Integrate with Istio/Linkerd for service-to-service auth

## Recommended Immediate Action

I recommend starting with **Testing and Validation** to ensure the Cedar implementation is robust:

1. Create comprehensive policy validation tests
2. Build authorization scenario tests covering all use cases
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Create integration tests for the enrollment system

Would you like me to:
- Create the policy validation test suite?
- Build the migration tools for existing RBAC data?
- Implement the policy management CLI commands?
- Create performance benchmarks?
- Work on shadow mode implementation?

Let me know which direction you'd like to go!
