# P2P Confusion Resolved

## Summary

The confusion stems from an outdated P2P_STATUS_REPORT.md file (dated July 1st) that documented issues with the old `IrohTransport` implementation. Since then, the codebase has been significantly upgraded:

## Current State (as of latest commits)

### ✅ What's Actually Working

1. **IrohTransportV2 Implementation**
   - Full document operations implemented (`create_or_join_doc`, `write_to_doc`, `read_from_doc`)
   - File sharing operations (`share_file`, `download_file`)
   - Peer communication (`send_to_peer`)
   - Discovery bridge integration
   - Connection monitoring and metrics

2. **P2pManager Uses IrohTransportV2**
   - Located in `blixard-core/src/p2p_manager.rs`
   - Imports: `use crate::iroh_transport_v2::{IrohTransportV2, DocumentType};`
   - Successfully creates and manages P2P connections

3. **P2pImageStore Uses IrohTransportV2**
   - Located in `blixard-core/src/p2p_image_store.rs`
   - Creates transport: `let transport = IrohTransportV2::new(node_id, data_dir).await?;`
   - Successfully calls: `transport.create_or_join_doc(DocumentType::VmImages, true).await?;`
   - All document operations are working

## Migration Status

### Old IrohTransport (Deprecated)
- Still exists at `blixard-core/src/iroh_transport.rs`
- Has stub implementations that return `Ok(())` for compatibility
- Only used in some old tests that haven't been migrated yet

### New IrohTransportV2 (Active)
- Located at `blixard-core/src/iroh_transport_v2.rs`
- Full implementation with all features
- Used by all production code (P2pManager, P2pImageStore, etc.)

## Remaining Uses of Old Transport

Only in test files:
- `tests/cluster_export_import_test.rs`
- `blixard-core/tests/p2p_integration_test.rs`
- `blixard-core/tests/p2p_simple_test.rs`

## Recommendations

1. **Delete P2P_STATUS_REPORT.md** - It's outdated and causing confusion
2. **Migrate remaining tests** to use IrohTransportV2
3. **Remove old IrohTransport** once all tests are migrated
4. **Update documentation** to reflect current working state

## Current P2P Features

Based on recent commits, the following P2P features are now working:
- ✅ P2P connectivity and initialization
- ✅ Document-based data sharing
- ✅ VM image distribution via P2P
- ✅ Automatic peer discovery
- ✅ Connection monitoring and metrics
- ✅ P2P address exchange in cluster operations
- ✅ ALPN protocol standardization

The NotImplemented errors mentioned in P2P_STATUS_REPORT.md are no longer relevant - they were for the old IrohTransport which has been replaced.
